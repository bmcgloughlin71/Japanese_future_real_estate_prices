# Japanese future real estate prices

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to predict and uncover patterns in the Japanese real estate economy and in doing so brush up on some general data analysis techniques.

## Data Sets
The 2005-2013 data set ultimately come from the MLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan) and taken from this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishiodens/japan-real-estate-transaction-prices?resource=download)

The more updated data set from 2005 to 2024 also come from the [MLIT](https://www.reinfolib.mlit.go.jp/realEstatePrices/)

## Regression Analysis
A number of approaches were taken including but not limited to over sampling data on the tails of the price distribution, creating custom loss functions, quantile regression and feature engineering.
Ultimately, the approach(es) with the best results so far are shown on this repo.
